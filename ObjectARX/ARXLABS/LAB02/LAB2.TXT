
LAB 2: Obtaining and manipulating an entity

Purpose:

 The purpose of this lab is to learn how you can create an AutoCad entity
 and add it to the database. You will also learn how to obtain an entity's
 id by selecting it and how to open it to obtain a pointer to it.  Once you
 obtain a pointer to an entity, you can query it for its class, its DXF
 name, its attribute values, etc. You can also change and manipulate its
 attributes. 

Lab Exercises:
 
 Find the "//..." comments in the .cpp files and follow directions to do
 the following:

  - Set the endpoint of the line entity and any other attributes you wish
    before you add the line entity to the database.

  - Modify an endpoint of the selected line entity using the point values
    acquired from the used via the function ads_getpoint().

  - Set the center point and the radius of the circle entity and any other
    attributes you wish before you add it to the database.

  - Using the point acquired from the user via the function ads_getpoint(),
    modify the center point of the selected circle entity.

  - Locate and study the statement where the objects are being closed.

Home Exercises:

 Create and register commands to modify an object's linetype, layer, etc.

 Create and register commands to acquire a different kind of entity.
