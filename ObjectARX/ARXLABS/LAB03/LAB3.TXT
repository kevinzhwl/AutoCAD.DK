
LAB 3: Navigating through tables and records

Purpose:

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the concepts AcDbBlockTable,
AcDbBlockTableRecord, and AcDbBlockTableRecordIterator. These concepts
allow you to create block table records and give them names, and to
retrieve and open block table records and iterate through them.

Lab Exercises:

 Find the "//..." comments in the .cpp files and follow directions to do
 the following:

 - Create a new block table record and set its name and block origin.

 - Retrieve a block table from a current drawing database and open it for
   write.
 
 - Add a new block table record to the retrieved block table and close the
   table.

 - Append clones of selected entities to the new block table record.

 - Open a block table for read and search for a block table record using
   its name.

 - Create a new table record iterator and use it to retrieve entities from
   the block table record. 

Home Exercises:

 - Write options to erase or append entities to a block table record using
   whatever criteria you like.
  
 - Erase all entities of or derived from class AcDbCircle from a block
   using the AcRxObject::isKindOf() function.
