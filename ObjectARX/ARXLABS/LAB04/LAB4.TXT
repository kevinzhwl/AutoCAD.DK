
LAB 4: Navigating through tables and records

Purpose:

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to symbol table iterators.  You
will be accessing the linetype table,  iterating through all it's records
printing out each record's linetype name.

Lab Exercises:

 Find the "//..." comments in the .cpp file and follow directions to do
 the following:
 
 - get a pointer to the linetypetable.
 
 - Create an iterator to walk the table from start to end.
 
 - make a loop to iterate through the table opening each record,
   accessing it's linetype name,  and printing it out using ads_printf().
 
 - Don't forget to close each linetypeTableRecord in the loop.
 
 - Once the loop is finished,  delete the iterator and close the linetype
   table.
