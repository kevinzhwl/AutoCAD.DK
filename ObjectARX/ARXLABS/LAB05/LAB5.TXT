
LAB 5: Database and AutoCAD Editor Reactors

Purpose:

 The purpose of this lab is to introduce the concept of AcDbDatabaseReactor
 which can be used to keep track of changes occurring to entities in a
 database. In this lab, you will learn how to attach a reactor to a 
 database to receive notification each time an entity changes.

 This lab also demonstrates how to create and use an AcEditor reactor
 to monitor AutoCAD editor events.

Lab Exercises:

 Find the "//..." comments in the .cpp files and follow directions to do
 the following:

 - If (dbmrOn) and the reactor named dbmr is NULL, create dbmr, and attach
   it the current drawing.

 - If (!dbmrOn) and dbmr is non-NULL, remove it from the current drawing,
   delete it, and reset its value to NULL.

Home Exercises:

 - Add an item to the dialog box to display a 3D point, then whenever the
   modified entity is a kind of AcDbLine, display its first endpoint.
