
LAB 6: Entity reactors

Purpose:

 The purpose of Lab06 is to show the creation of persistent and
 non-persistent object/entity reactors.

Lab Exercises:
 
 Find the "//..." comments in the .cpp file and follow directions to do
 the following:
 
 - In attachMessages(),  add code to the MsgReactor to the selected
   entity and then close the entity.
 
 - In createLines():

   * Attach a newly created non-persistent reactor to a newly created
     AcDbLine entity.

   * Create and plant another instance on the other new AcDbLine.

   * Don't forget to Close everything.

 - In createPersistent(),  add code to attach a Jpreactor to the selected
   entity.

Home Exercises:

 - Create a DXF file and see if you can find both the entity and the
   persistent reactor in the DXF file.

 - Rewrite createLines() to use persistent reactors, giving them names "A"
   and "B" in the named object dictionary.  Beware of open conflicts.
