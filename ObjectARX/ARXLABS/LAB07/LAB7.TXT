
LAB 7: Protocol Extension:  Entity Temperature

Purpose:

 The purpose of this lab is to explore the mechanics of using Protocol
 Extension  to effectively add virtual functions to existing classes.

 Study the makeup of the protocol extension class EntTemperature in
 TEMPAPP.CPP, and implementations for AcDbCircle, AcDbRegion and a default
 for AcDbEntity.  The value being computed is nonsensical, the point is the
 class and object structure involved.

Lab Exercises: 

 - Add a call in the energy() function to execute the protocol extension
   for the entity pointer passed to the energy function.

 - In the initApp function,  fill in the necessary code to add the protocol
   extension to AcDbEntity, AcDbRegion,  and AcDbCircle.

 - In the unloadApp function,  add code to remove the protocol extension
   from AcDbEntity, AcDbRegion,  and AcDbCircle.

Optional:

 - Create an implementation for AcDbEllipse.  There are comments
   throughout the lab where you need to add code explaining what needs
   to be added.

Home Exercises:

  Use Protocol Extension in conjunction with XDATA to store a scalar
  floating point value on selected AcDbEntities.  At least two member
  functions are needed: to set and retrieve the value.
