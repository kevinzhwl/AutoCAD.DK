
LAB 8: Custom Objects

Purpose:

 The purpose of this lab is to show what it takes to create a simple custom
 object (not an entity) -- MYCLASS.  A MYCLASS object is a simple object
 that has only one data member to store an intger.  The myclass object
 class provides support to read and write to DWG and DXF and to get and set
 the integer data member.

 The CREATE command in the program will create a dictionary, add it to the
 named objects dictionary, and then create some objects of myclass and add
 them to the new dictionary.

 The ITERATE command will find the new dictionary and iterate over it
 printing out the values of the integer data members of the myclass objects
 stored within it.

Lab Exercises: 

 In samp2.cpp look for the "// ..."  comments.  These indicate where there
 is code missing that you must add in.  The comments preceding the "//..."
 will explain what's needed at that point.

 Once done,  build and try.  

Home Exercises:

 Try elaborating the myclass class to have more data members of different
 types.

 Enhance the create_dictionary and iterate_dictionary functions to allow
 more interactive creation and reporting.

 Try adding objectId data members to the myclass class.  Keep in mind that
 for dxfInFields(),  an objectId comes in as an ads_name so it must
 be translated to an AcDbObjectId object using the global function
 acdbGetObjectId() (see dbmain.h for it's signature).
