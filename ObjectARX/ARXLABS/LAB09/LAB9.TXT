
LAB 9: Custom Entity

Purpose:

 The purpose of this lab is to show what it takes to create a simple custom
 entity -- JBLOB.  A JBLOB is a filled circle with a line protruding from
 it like a lolipop.

 The jblob entity class provides support to draw the entity,  read and
 write to DWG and DXF,  explode,  list,  osnap (near,  end,  mid,  cen, 
 quad),  grip editing (move and stretch),  and transformations like scale 
 and move.

 In addition,  Jblob shows how to properly implement the audit() member
 function.  saveAs() is also implemented to show how to generate
 different graphics for saveasr12 and proxy graphics save.

 The JBLOB.ARX program will create JBLOB entities and add them to the
 database.

 There are two source files in this lab,  jblob.cpp and main.cpp.  The
 main.cpp is complete as is.  

 The jblob.cpp source file contains the code that defines the JBLOB entity
 class.  Many of the methods for this class are incomplete and must be
 filled in by you.

Lab Exercises: 

 In jblob.cpp look for the "// ..."  comments.  These indicate where there
 is code missing that you must add in.

 In many of these functions,  you can leave them as is and still build
 and run the program.  This will allow you to complete a little,  test,
 complete some more,  test, and so forth until it's all done.

Home Exercises:

 Try deriving JBLOB from AcDbCurve instead of AcDbEntity.  This will
 involve a long list of new virtual functions to implement,  but the
 JBLOB entity will be much more versatile.
