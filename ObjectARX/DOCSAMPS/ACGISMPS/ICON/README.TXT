Filename:

Description:
  viewportDraw() (window coords)

  This example demonstrates the main use of polylineDc(),
  polygonDc() and getViewportDcCorners() -- graphics
  that depend on the physical layout of the viewport,
  like icons, markers, or borders that vary with the
  size of the viewport.

  For the demonstration,  this example draws a box in
  the upper right corner of the viewport.  The box's
  width and height are always a tenth of the viewport's
  shortest dimension and are centered a tenth of the
  viewport's shortest dimension down and to the left of
  the upper righthand corner of the viewport.

Procedure:
 1. Load icon.arx
 2. Command: ASDKICONSAMP
 3. Command: TILEMODE 0
 4. Command: MVIEW
    ON/OFF/Hideplot/Fit/2/3/4/Restore/<First Point>:
    Select First Point and Other Corner

    You should see a red rectangular shape in the upper
    right corner proportional to the viewport.
   
    The Developer's Guide and the source code explains what took
    place in more detail.
