Description:
  worldDraw() (subentity traits)

  This sample demonstrates using many of the AcGiSubEntityTraits
  class functions for controlling the properties of the graphics
  primitives drawn during entity elaboration.

Procedure:
 1. Load traits.arx
 2. Command: LINETYPE Load DASHDOT from acad.lin
 3. Command: LAYER Make MY_LAYER Color Red
 4. Command: ASDKTRAITSSAMP

    Three point blue POLYLINE at (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) and
    an XLINE in MY_LAYER using DASHDOT linetype should appear.

    The Developer's Guide and the source code explains what took
    place in more detail.
