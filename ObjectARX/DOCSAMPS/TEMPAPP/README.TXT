Program tempapp.cpp

1.      Create a few lines, circles, ellipses, etc. in AutoCAD.
2.      Load the arx application.
3.	Command: energy (This command works on circles and regions only.  For
	entities which are neither regions nor circles, a default value of -1

	is converted from a circle to a region.)
