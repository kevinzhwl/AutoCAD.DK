
Refer to the ARX Developer's Guide

To use xrecord.arx:

1. Start AutoCAD and open a new drawing.

2. Type the ARX command and load xrecord.arx.

3. Type the CREATE command, defined by xrecord.arx. This will create
a test x record.

4. Type the LISTXREC command, defined by xrecord.arx. This will list 
out the x record created above.

Don't use the LISTXREC command before CREATE. AutoCAD will disappear from
your screen if you do!
