This example creates two image entities of one image definition object.
It transforms and clips one of the image entities.





START
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Load ism.arx at first. ISM stands for Image Support Module.

Then load IsmExample.arx. 
If that does not exist you need to build it. Please see section Build.

In order for the arx application to load the image: add the image directory to 
the preferences project directories (command PREFERENCES) and set this 
project as the current one (Set Current).
		
Start the example with the command ISMEXAMPLE from the command line.

It shows you one clipped image on top of on image. 

You can zoom out to see that the clipped image is placed on a large image.





CLASSES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

EXAMPLE

CustomApplication

The one and only class of this example has the name CustomApplication.

Purpose:   Example class of using the Image Support Module (ISM).
           It can attach an image by creating an entity, definition and reactor.
           Also it can add the object to the model or paper space.

Problems:  The image path has to be updated in the newImageAttach method.

If the path of the image atoll.gif changes and you run into problems by executing 
the example, then please see the section "Problems:", "Cannot load the image:". 



ISM

The classes that uses the example from the ism.lib are:
AcDbRasterImage
AcDbRasterImageDef
AcDbRasterImageDefReactor
AcDbRasterVariables

For information about this classes and additional classes of the ISM API 
please see ARX Reference help.

BUILD
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

The makefile has relative paths and works from the location:
Acad\arx\samples\ism

You can add the image directory to the preferences project directories 
(command PREFERENCES) and set this project as the current one (Set Current).




PROBLEMS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

ATTACHING THE SAME IMAGE DEFINITION AGAIN:

Running the example for a second time, causes an error message.
The reason is that you tried to attach an image definition object with a name 
that already exists in the dictionary.


SOLUTIONS:

Manually:
You can detach the definition object manually. Use the command IMAGE, 
select the definition object of the image "ATOLL" and press the "DETACH" button.


Change of code:
You can use the API method suggestName of the class AcDbRasterImageDef 
to get an unused image name. See ARX Reference help for further information
about the ISM API.


Change of code:
In the method createAcDbRasterImageDef is a check for the image name: 	
        // Check if image name already in use.
It returns the value Acad::eHandleInUse, if the state is "name in use".
You need to get the object Id of this image definition object and allow
the error status Acad::eHandleInUse in the method newImageAttach after:
        // Create image definition object.
This solution has the benefit to the previous solution that it does not create
an additional definition object. This saves a lot of memory.



CANNOT LOAD THE IMAGE:

The reason is that the path could not be found.
In this example in the method newImageAttach of the class CustomApplication 
is the name and the path of the image defined.
        // definition
	ImageName = "atoll";
	ImagePath = "atoll.gif";

In this case the path is the active directory.  


SOLUTIONS:

Manually:
Set in Preferences (command: PREFERENCES), Files, Project Files the path of the image atoll.gif,
and set this project to your active one (Set Current). 


Change of the code:
Change the variable value of ImagePath. Be sure to use double backslashes "\\". 
The image path also includes the filename and extension itself.

Example:
         ImagePath = "C:\\ACAD\\ARX\\samples\\ism\\atoll.gif";
