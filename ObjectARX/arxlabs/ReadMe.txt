Explorer(TM) version 4 or higher. However you can use Netscape(TM) if you prefer. 
The structure of the tutorial is as follows:


arxlabs          <- Contains 'Readme.txt' and 'ObjectARX 2002 Tutorial.htm' files.
  |_htmls        <- Contains support HTML and JPEG files.
  |_Step01       <- Empty. (Use this to store your Step 1 project).
  |   |_solved   <- Contains the solved solution to Step 1 of the tutorial.
  |_Step02       <- Empty. (Use this to store your Step 2 project).
  |_Step03       <- Contains project files for start of Step 3 of the tutorial.
  |_Step04       <- Contains project files for start of Step 4 of the tutorial.
  |_Step05       <- Contains project files for start of Step 5 of the tutorial.

The labs consist of Step 1 through Step 7. The folder 'Step08' contains the
completed application that is based on the previous steps. It is recommended
that you complete the steps in order. The source code that is contained in a
particular 'step' folder represents the starting code for this portion of the
tutorial. If, for example, you are working on Step 6, the complete code for the
Step 6 lesson is contained in the 'Step07' folder. The code that is contained
in the 'Step06' folder represents the starting point for the Step 6 lesson.
