Lab6Command

Purpose:
=======

The purpose of this lab is to create yet another custom class, EmployeeEntry. 
Instances of this class replace the xrecords created in Lab4. These objects
simply store an AcDbObjectId, the object ID of EmployeeDetails objects 
created in Lab5. This will enable us to iterate through all the employees 
in the database quickly and easily. The listEmps command demonstrates this.


Steps:
======

1. You will need to merge the commands you created in Lab4 and Lab5Commands.
   I suggest you start with Lab5 and copy and paste parts of your code from 
   Lab4 into the project.

2. Replace the AcDbXrecord instances in the code from Lab4 with the instances 
   of EmployeeEntry.

3. Set the ID stored in the EmployeeEntry object to the block reference 
   representing the employee.
