Lab6Object

Purpose: 
=======

The purpose of this lab is to create yet another custom class EmployeeEntry. 
Instances of this class replace the xrecords created in Lab4. These objects
simply store an AcDbObjectId, the object ID of EmployeeDetails objects 
created in Lab5. This will enable us to iterate through all the employees 
in the database quickly and easily. The listEmps command demonstrates this. 

Steps:
======

1. You can easily model this lab after lab5Object. There are no new concepts introduced.
   This will give you a chance to practice the skill you acquired in previous labs.
   Copy the files of lab5Object and rename them appropriately.
2. Create two new files-lab6ObjectEmployeeEntry.h and lab6ObjectEmployeeEntry.cpp.
   These files will contain the definition of the new class EmployeeEntry.
3. Follow the steps in lab5Object to define this new class.
   It will have one data member (besides the standard version member):
   AcDbObjectId m_idEmp;
