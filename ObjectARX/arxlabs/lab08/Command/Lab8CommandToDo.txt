Lab8

Purpose: /This appears in The Plan.doc/
=======

The purpose of this lab is to create yet another custom class EmployeeEntry.
Instances of this class replace the xrecords created in Lab4. 
These objects simply store an AcDbObjectId, the object ID of EmployeeDetails
objects created in Lab5. 
This will enable us to iterate through all the employees
in the database quickly and easily. The listEmps command demonstrates this.
