// Note: Because of the "local vtable" problem with msvc if 
// you use __declspec(dllimport), then, when a client dll 
// does a new on the class, the object's vtable pointer points 
// to a vtable allocated in that client dll. If the client dll 
// then passes the object to another dll, and the client dll is 
// then unloaded, the vtable becomes invalid and any virtual 
// calls on the object will access invalid memory.
//
// There is a workaround for the case that you are not using
// static variables in your class declaration:
// By not using __declspec(dllimport), we guarantee that the
// vtable is allocated in the server dll during the ctor and the
// client dll does not overwrite the vtable pointer after calling
// the ctor.  And, since we expect the server dll to remain in
// memory indefinitely, there is no problem with vtables 
// unexpectedly going away.
//
// In our case we are using a static member variable to store 
// the version information. This means that we have to use 
// __declspec(dllimport) and we cannot pass an object created 
// in a client of this dll to another dll.
