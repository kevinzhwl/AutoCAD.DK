Lab8

Purpose:
=======

The purpose of this lab is to create a persistent object reactor.
This reactor will remove the EmployeeEntry from the employee dictionary 
if the insert EMPLOYEE is erased. 
For this you have only to overwrite in the class EmployeeDetails the 
virtual void erased (const AcDbObject* pDbObj,Adesk::Boolean erasing = Adesk::kTrue) 
function inherited from AcDbObject.
