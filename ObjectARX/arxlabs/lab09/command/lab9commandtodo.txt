Implementing a Command to Create an AcDbEmployee
================================================

A) Step 1 - Importing the ARX class

Examine the code in Lab9cMain.cpp to determine how the AcDbEmployee class
is imported in the module.

The solution is at the end of the file!

B) Step 2 - Create a new command

Examine the command that creates an AcDbEmployee entity.

C) Step 3 - Building and running the module

Please refer to file Lab9Todo.txt in the parent directory for instructions.






























Solution of Step 1:

You should find '#include "Employee.h"', which declares the class.
And ACRX_DEFINE_MEMBERS(AcDbEmployee), which defines the ARX-based 
methods required.
