Lab 9
=====

Open Lab9.dsw workspace in VC6.

This contains three subprojects named Lab9, Lab9a (two different 
implementations of the AcDbEmployee Object), and Lab9c (the 
implementation of the commands).

You have to follow the description you find in the files 
named Lab9ObjectToDo.txt, Lab9aToDo.txt resp., and Lab9CommandToDo.txt.

When done, come back to this file and process instructions below.


A) Step 1 - Set Lab9 as your active project and build the object module.

   Step 2 - Set Lab9c as your active project and build the command module.

Run the sample by loading OarxLab9c.arx in AutoCAD. Then enter the command Lab9c
on the AutoCAD command line to create an object of type AcDbEmployee.

B) Step 1 - Set Lab9a as your active project and build the object module.

   Step 2 - Set Lab9c as your active project.
          - Change the LAB9OBJECT preprocessor directive to LAB9OBJECTA.
          - Build the command module (now it will use the object from OarxLab9a.arx).

Run the sample by loading OarxLab9c.arx in AutoCAD. Then enter the command Lab9c
on the AutoCAD command line to create an object of type AcDbEmployee.
