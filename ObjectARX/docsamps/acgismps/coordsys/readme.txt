  viewportDraw() (transforms)        

  This example demonstrates the use of isPerspective(),
  doPerspective(),  getBackAndFrontClippingValues(),
  polygonDc(),  polygonEye(), and polygon().

  To do this,  it takes an original line segment in
  model coords and creates its equivalents in eye
  and display coords.  When displayed, all lines 
  will overlap exactly.

Procedure:
 1. Load coordsys.arx
 2. Command: ASDKCOORDSAMP

    The Developer's Guide and the source code explains what took
    place in more detail.
