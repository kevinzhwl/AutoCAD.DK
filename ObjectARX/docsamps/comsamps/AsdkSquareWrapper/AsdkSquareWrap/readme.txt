
This example is an ATL COM Wrapper for ObjectARX Custom Entity. This project builds
a DLL that will be loaded when COM access to the custom entity is requested (for example,
by the Object Property Manager).

It works with the Square Sample application found in the adjacent subdirectory.

Build the Square sample first, then build this project. This project uses the 
square.lib file produced by building the square sample.
