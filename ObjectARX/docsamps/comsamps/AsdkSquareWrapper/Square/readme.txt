
This example is a simple Custom Entity defining a Square. It supports the AsdkSquareWrapper
ATL COM sample in the adjacent subdirectory.

Build this Square sample first, then build the AsdkSquareWrapper project. The AsdkSquareWrapper
project uses the square.lib file produced by building the this sample.
