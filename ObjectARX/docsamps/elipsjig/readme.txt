  AcEdJig sample program

  This program demonstrates how to use AcEdJig to provide a
  user interface for AcDbEllipse creation that's slightly
  different from that provided by AutoCAD itself.
 
  One limitation in it's current form is that if the user
  tries to make the minor axis longer than the major axis,
  then the ellipse will end up circular because the radius
  ratio cannot be larger than 1.0.

1. Load elipsjig.arx
2. Command: ASDK_VELLIPSE
3. Select center point, major axis, and minor axis

   An ellipse should have been created.
