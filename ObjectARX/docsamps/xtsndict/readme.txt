Description:

This program demonstrates using extension dictionaries.
Two commands are defined in this program:  CREATE, and
LISTXREC.
 
The CREATE command calls the function createXrecord()
which instantiates an xrecord object and adds it to the
extension dictionary of a user selected object.

The LISTXREC command calls the listXrecord() function
which opens the extension dictionary of a user selected
object, looks for the xrecord created by the CREATE
command and then calls the printList() function to print
out the data stored in the xrecord.

There are two versions of this project. The first use pure 
ObjectARX methods. The second uses the old style C interface
methods and is meant to show the different approaches.


To use xtsndict.arx

1. Load the arx application
2. Draw an entity
3. Command: create  (select the entity)
    This will create an extension dictionary for the selected
    entity and place an Xrecord object within it.

4. Command: listxrec (select the entity)
    This will list the contents of the Xrecord in the extension
    dictionary of the entity selected.  Do not select an entity
    that has not had an extension dictionary and Xrecord created
    by the create command (or equivalent).
