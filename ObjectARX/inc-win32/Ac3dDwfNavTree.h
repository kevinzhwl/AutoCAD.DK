/// <summary>
/// This class describes the interface that must be implemented by the 
/// (optional) NavTree Publisher. The NavTree publisher controls what will 
/// appear in the navigation tree in the Viewer.
/// If no NavTree publisher is passed in to the Ac3dDwfPublisher, then it
/// will display a "flat" tree listing all the objects with their class names
/// and handles.
///
/// You must create an object that implements the Ac3dDwfNavTreePublisher interface,
/// i.e. an object that derives from Ac3dDwfNavTreePublisher and implements its functions.
/// You will get called after each entity is done publishing its graphics and properties.
/// Use those calls to build a tree of Ac3dDwfNavTreeNode's, based on the data
/// in the Ac3dDwfEntityHeader. That data includes the "Graphics keys" which are
/// used in the DWF to identify the graphics associated with the entity.
/// When all other publishing is done, the Ac3dDwfPublisher will ask you for that
/// tree by asking for its root node: Ac3dDwfNavTreeNode* root();
///
