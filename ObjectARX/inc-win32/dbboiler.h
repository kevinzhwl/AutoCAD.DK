// DESCRIPTION: Main Exported Database Library Definitions.
//     Macros primarily used in the api headers

#include "rxboiler.h"

// Macro for common declarations of classes derived from
// AcDbObject which are built into AutoCAD.
//
// This macro is NOT intended for application-defined classes derived
// from AcDbObject when declaring their class header.  This macro declares
// an internally used form of constructor, which takes the
// AcDbSystemInternals* argument.  Rx applications should not define
// such constructors for their database object classes, but they should
// be ignored by the system anyway.
//
// Application-defined classes are advised to use the ACRX_DECLARE_MEMBERS
// macro instead, and to consult the documentation for related definitions.
//

// The acdbOpenObject() function is a template function defined in
// dbmain.h where the first parameter is of type (CLASSNAME *&).
// The following macro exists for backwards compatibility with prior
// source which required use of this macro to define a type-specific
// version acdbOpenObject().
