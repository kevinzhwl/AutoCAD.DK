// DESCRIPTION:
//
// This file contains the definition for a dynamic array, called
// AcDbObjectIdArray, of objects of type "AcDbObjectId".
//
// "Dynamic array" means that the array can grow without bounds,
// unlike declaring an array of objects of type "AcDbObjectId" in the
// usual manner.  For example declaring "AcDbObjectId myArray[10]"
// is limited to holding only ten entries.
//
// In order to use the class AcDbObjectIdArray, you need to understand
// a couple of simple, yet key, concepts:
//
//     1) The logical length of the array.
//            - How many entries have been placed into the array,
//              initially always zero.
//     2) The physical length of the array.
//            - How many entries the array will hold before it
//              automatically "grows" larger.
//     3) The grow length of the array.
//            - How much the array will grow when required.
//
// The physical length of the array is the actual length of the
// physically allocated, but perhaps not fully used, array.
// As a point of clarification, the size in bytes of the array
// buffer for an array called `myArray' would be:
//
//     sizeOf(AcDbObjectId) * myArray.physicalLength().
//
// The physical length of the array can be zero or any positive
// integer.
//
// The logical length of the array (or just the "length()") reflects
// how many elements of AcDbObjectId have been placed into the array
// with, for example, append() or insertAt().  Many member-functions
// are only valid for indices that are greater than or equal to
// zero AND less than length().  For example, indexing into the
// array with the operator[] is only valid for indices in this range.
//
// You can explicitly set the logical length() to any value and
// if the physical length is not large enough the array will grow to
// that length.  Note that if the logical length is explicitly reset
// to a larger value, then all the entries from the old length up
// to the new length may contain garbage values, therefor they must be
// initialized explicitly.
//
// The logical length is always less than or equal to the physical
// length.  NOTE that the array ALWAYS starts out empty, i.e., the
// length() always starts at zero regardless of the initial physical
// length.
//
// If you add an element to the array causing the logical length
// to become greater than the physical length of the array then
// the "grow length" determines how much additional space to
// allocate, and the physical length will increase by the grow length.
//
// The grow length must be a positive number, that is, zero is an illegal
// grow length.
