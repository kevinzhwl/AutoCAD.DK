/// <summary> <para>
/// Any object that wants to exhibit associative behavior, i.e. be automatically 
/// evaluated by the associative mechanism when objects it depends on change, 
/// needs to be derived from an AcDbAssocActionBody class (see comments at the
/// AcDbAssocActionBody class) and owned by a parent AcDbAssocAction object. The 
/// action body is fully owned by its parent action, such as when the parent 
/// action is erased, it also erases the owned action body. 
/// </para> <para>
/// The AcDbAssocAction class itself does not have virtual methods that could be 
/// overridden, therefore it is not possible for external developers to derive 
/// directly from the AcDbAssocAction class and override its methods. Internal 
/// AutoCAD developers can derive from the AcDbImpAssocAction class and override 
/// its virtual methods, but it should only be done when there is no possibility 
/// that objects of the derived action classes could become proxies.
/// </para> <para>
/// Each action is owned by an AcDbAssocNetwork that itself is an action, 
/// therefore hirearchical associative structures can be represented. 
/// </para> <para>
/// The main protocol of the AcDbAssocAction class is the evaluate() method that
/// calls the evaluateOverride() method of the owned AcDbAssocActionBody object. 
/// </para> <para>
/// Actions own AcDbAssocDependency objects that allow the actions to depend on
/// arbitrary AcDbObjects. This is how the connectivity in the network is 
/// represented. When objects the dependencies depend on change, the dependencies 
/// are notified, actions owning the dependencies are notified and also the 
/// hierarchy of the networks owning the actions is notified. This notification 
/// just changes AcDbAssocStatus of the dependencies and of the actions/networks
/// to "dirty", it does not trigger any action evaluation. 
/// </para> <para>
/// The actual action evaluation happens when the client code calls the evalaute()
/// method on the top-level network. This automatically evaluates all the actions 
/// the network owns that need to be evaluated because they depend, either 
/// directly or transitively, on objects that changed. If an action modifies an
/// object (has a write-dependency on it) and there is another action that uses
/// the modified object (has read-dependency on it), then, if the first action
/// is evaluated, the second action also needs to be transitively evaluated. 
/// </para> <para>
/// The flow of information is as follows:
/// </para> <para>
///
///   Object1 --ReadDep--> Action1 --WriteDep1--> Object2 --ReadDep--> Action2 ...
///
/// <para> </para>
/// Notice that an action may depend on multiple objects and may modify multiple 
/// other objects. The network forms a directed acyclic graph. The evalution 
/// algoritm makes sure that all actions that need to be evaluated are evaluated 
/// and that the evaluation happens in the correct order so that every action
/// is evaluated only after all other actions that modify objects this action
/// depends on have already been evaluated (the situation is actually litle 
/// bit more complex, there are other aspects controlling the evaluation order).
/// </para> <para>
/// The AcDbAssocManager::evaluateTopLevelNetwork() static method should be used 
/// to evaluate the top-level network of the database. It will collect and 
/// evaluate all the actions that need to be evaluated. Explicit evaluation of 
/// the individual sub-networks is not recommended.
