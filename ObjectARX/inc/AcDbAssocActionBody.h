/// Abstract base class for deriving custom action body classes that implement
/// functionality of custom actions.
/// </para> <para>
/// An object of a class derived from the AcDbAssocActionBody class is always 
/// owned by a parent AcDbAssocAction object. The AcDbAssocAction object has 
/// an AcDbHardOwnershipId on it and the AcDbAssocActionBody::ownerId() of the 
/// object returns the AcDbObjectId of its parent AcDbAssocAction object. 
/// </para> <para>
/// Therefore a custom action object (in the logical sense of the word "object") 
/// is always represented by a pair of physical AcDbObjects: 
///
///  - The parent action object of the AcDbAssocAction class (or possibly, but
///    less commonly, of a derived class).
///  - The action body object of a custom class derived from the 
///    AcDbAssocActionBody abstract base class.
///
/// </para> <para>
/// This factoring out of the functionality of the custom actions into separate 
/// classes derived from the AcDbAssocActionBody class, instead of deriving the 
/// custom action classes directly from the AcDbAssocAction class, allows
/// better handling of the situations when the application code that implements 
/// the custom action behavior is not available. Only the custom object of the
/// AcDbAssocActionBody-derived class will become a proxy, but its parent 
/// AcDbAssocAction object will always be available and the associative mechanism
/// can still function to some extent.
/// </para> <para>
/// The abstract AcDbAssocActionBody base class defines a set of virtual methods 
/// named xxxxxxOverride() that correspond to methods named xxxxxx() in the parent
/// AcDbAssocAction class. When a method xxxxxx() is called on the parent action 
/// object and the action object owns an action body object, the corresponding 
/// xxxxxxOverride() method on the action body object is called and it either 
/// supersedes or amends the default xxxxxx() implementation, depending on the 
/// particular method. 
/// </para> <para>
/// If the action object does not own an action body object or if the action 
/// body object does not override the xxxxxxOverride() method, the default
/// implementation in the parent action object is performed. Also, when the 
/// custom action body object becomes a proxy because its application code
/// is not available, the parent action method just performs its default 
/// implementation.
/// </para> <para>
/// Custom action body classes derived from the AcDbAssocActionBody class 
/// implement their behavior by overriding the appropriate xxxxxxOverride() 
/// methods. Only the evaluateOverride() method must always be overridden in 
/// the custom classes. If not overridden, the other xxxxxxOverride() methods 
/// will do nothing and the default implementation in the parent AcDbAssocAction 
/// object will be performed. This may be the appropriate behavior in most cases.
/// </para> <para>
/// The custom action body classes also need to serialize their data. When 
/// serializing AcDbObjectIds of the AcDbAssocDependencies, these should be 
/// serialized as AcDbHardPointerIds, not as AcDbHardOwnershipIds, because the 
/// AcDbAssocDependencies are owned (in the AutoCAD database sense) by the 
/// parent AcDbAssocAction object, not by the custom action body object. 
/// </para> <para>
/// Because each AcDbAssocActionBody object is owned by its parent 
/// AcDbAssocAction object, erasing the parent AcDbAssocAction object also 
/// erases the owned AcDbAssocActionBody object. There is no need to erase
/// AcDbAssocActionBody objects explicitly.
