// ACDB_API is defined when compile acdb. But not when compile Gelib.dylib.
// Gelib.dylib would try to link to virtual functions declared by AcRxObject. However,
// there is no implementation Gelib project can see. Unless they are pure virtual function, there would be
// linker error.
// On the other hand, when compiling acdb, these virtual function can't be pure virtual, otherwise,
// they will prevent from instantialize subclass objects. And the implementation of
// the virtual functions are in rxinit.cpp which is compiled into acdb.
// So we will leave GCC_NO_VTABLE to empty when compile acdb.
