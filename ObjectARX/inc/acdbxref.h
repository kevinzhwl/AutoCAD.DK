/*      AcDbXref.h
        This file contains the definition of the functions used to handle
        xrefs in DBX.  These are exported from AcDbXref.dll.
*/

/* acdbResolveCurrentXRefs --
   This function is used to resolve xrefs at drawing load.
   acdbResolveCurrentXRefs() will get and load xref database
   files and merge the symbol tables from the xrefs into the
   symbol tables of the host drawing. The host database should
   not be an xref in another drawing. If this is the case, the
   function does nothing.  The acdbHostApplicationServices methods
   isRemoteFile(), getRemoteFile(), mapFile(), and findFile()
   will be used by acdbResolveCurrentXRefs() to access the xref
   files if these functions are provided. Otherwise, the xrefs
   will be accessed at the path assigned to them when the host
   drawing was saved.

   Some functionality is not included in the xref resolve. This includes:
       Xref notification events
       Xref message logging
       Xref lazy loading (The xref drawing will be opened in mode
                          SH_DENYNO and AcDbDatabase::closeInput()
                          will be called after the drawing is read.)

    Note  This function supports xref resolution, but not xref
    database editing. You will not be able to reliably query or
    modify some elements of the xref databases. Nor will you be
    able to save your changes because the AcDbDatabase methods
    needed to restore the integrity of xref databases,
    restoreOriginalXrefSymbols() and restoreForwardingXrefSymbols(),
    are not implemented for ObjectDBX.
