// should use these type names along with those supplied by C++ itself
// (for example, int, long, float, double, etc.)
//
// See adeskabb.h for abbreviations of the following names.

//  These are constant definitions: regardless of whether the Unicode

//  will always be an 8-bit character.
//
//  Note: use LEGACY_CHAR to represent *textual* information; do not
//  use it for 8-bit binary data; the AC_BYTE type, below, is intended
//  for that use.  Use legacy characters sparingly, where ACHAR is 
//  inappropriate.

//  One of the (ab)uses of the char type is to point to bytes of memory.
//  The (void*) isn't good for this because the sizeof a void element may
//  not be what one expects.  This type is offered as a generic pointer
//  to memory, but in which sizeof(element) == 1.  We use char instead
//  of byte only because signed/unsigned mismatches will cause a flurry
//  of warnings in the transition; eventually, the type can be anything
//  we want.

// Use ADESK_NO_VTABLE on base classes which:
//   1. have virtual methods
//   2. are never instantiated
//   3. have a ctor and/or a dtor
//   4. do not call any virtual methods in the ctor or dtor
// This allows the compiler to avoid assigning a vtable pointer at
// the top of the base class's ctor and dtor.  So the vtable itself
// and any methods it points to which aren't used elsewhere can be
// omitted by the linker and reduce overall space.
//
// Make sure though that the base class is never instantiated.  Making
// the ctor protected or using pure virtual methods can help with this.
