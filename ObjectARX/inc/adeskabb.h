// DESCRIPTION:
//
// Using the fully qualified names from the `Adesk' struct can be
// cumbersome.	If there are no global name conflicts use the
// following synonyms for convenience.
//
// Note:  All interface descriptions must use fully qualified names.
//	  That is, header files MUST NOT include this file and MUST
//	  NOT use these abbreviations.
//
// Note:  If any of the following abbreviations cause conflicts and
//	  this file cannot be included, then the acceptable abbreviations
//	  (those that do not cause conflicts) will have to be manually
//	  introduced, or another abbreviation header file will have to
//	  be created containing only the acceptable abbreviations.
//
// Note:  When this file is included in a source file, it MUST BE
//	  included AFTER all other include files (except possibly
//	  other abbreviation include files).
//	  For example:
//            #include "foo.h"
//            #include "bar.h"
//            #include "adeskabb.h" // <- Must be last!

#include "adesk.h"
