/// AcDbAuditRecreatePE
///
/// Defines Runtime Extension Protocol for audit-time object recreation
///
/// The contract is rather simple, although the implementation may
/// be less so.   All 3 member functions are invoked from the AcDb
/// library, in the context of RECOVER and/or AUDIT.  The contract is:
///
/// When an object of a given class is requested via
/// AcDbAuditInfo::fetchObject, and is not valid, then
/// first, the PE object's replace(...) member is invoked.
/// if it returns eOk and a new instance of a class, then that
/// instance is place in the original object id, and the repair is
/// finished.
///
/// If that fails, then the PE object's redirect(...) member
/// is invoked. If it returns
/// true, and then the new object id is entered into the
/// indirect object lookup table.
///
/// if redirect(...) returns false, then the object reference
/// is no longer valid, and "NULL" is returned for a new object is.
///
/// Instances of this class will be invoked from the Audit complex when
/// an instance of a given class is to "recreated" because an original
/// one is missing.
