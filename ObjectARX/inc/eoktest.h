//   Macros for asserting and checking whether an Acad::ErrorStatus is eOk.
//
//   eOkVerify always checks for whether the expression is eOk and
//   returns TRUE if it is, FALSE if it isn't.
//
//   In addition, in debug builds, eOkVerify puts up a message box when
//   the expression does not equal eOk.
//
//   You might be thinking it would be nice to have an eOkAssert()
//   macro, which doesn't evaluate the expression in release builds,
//   similar to the ASSERT macro.  That would avoid the overhead of
//   computing the boolean result when it's not needed.  But this
//   seemed dangerous, in that it would be easy for someone to put
//   needed code inside eOkAssert, and that code would not get called
//   in release builds.  Also, the compiler already "optimizes out"
//   expressions whose results are not used.  So eOkVerify() doesn't
//   add overhead in release builds anyway.
