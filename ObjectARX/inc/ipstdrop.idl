// The purpose of this interface is to allow a component to handle right drag and drop
// in the most flexible way.
// A component may or may not want to handle the drop. Its reply to QueryDoDrop() indicates
// that the default processing will occur, or that the component will handle the drop.
// If the component wants to handle the drop, the interface allows two situations. The first one
// is that the component wants an immediate action for the drop. Then it will run the drop code from
// the PreparePostDrop() method, and will return a value indicating that the drop is done. The second situation
// is that the component wants to present a menu for the user to choose an action. PreparePostDrop() will then 
// return a value indicating the drop is not done yet. In this situation, QueryContextMenu() will be called,
// allowing the component to supply a menu. The user selection will be giving to the component by the component
// by the InvokeCommand() method. Finally, in both situation where PreparePostDrop() has been called, 
// EndPostDrop() is called to let the component performing some cleanup if necessary.
