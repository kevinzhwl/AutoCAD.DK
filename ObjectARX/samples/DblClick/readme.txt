DblClickSamp.arx is a sample that demonstrates the use of the new AutoCAD 2000i
double click API feature. The sample works with 'PLINE', 'SPLINE' and 'CIRCLE' entities.

When a user double-clicks a PLINE or SPLINE, a vertex or fit-point will be added at the 
cursor location. When a CIRCLE is double-clicked, the color index is changed. When any
other entity is double-clicked, the Object Property Manager is displayed for it.
