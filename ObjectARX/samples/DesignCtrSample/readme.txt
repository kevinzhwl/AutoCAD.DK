DesignCtrSample sample Readme.txt

This sample demonstrates how to add additional content, (such as
a DWG file), to the Autodesk Design Center.

The application is basically a in-proc COM server that will be loaded into
AutoCAD's memory space. Please note load the DesignCtrSample.arx manually into 
AutoCAD the first time so it get registered.

Here are the steps to create the project:

1. Use Atl Com AppWizard to create a dll, choose "Support MFC" and
   include "ISupportErrorInfo".
2. Manually delete the CWinApp derived class and its implementation.
3. Add acrxEntryPoint() and DllMain() and appropriate headers; Note that 
   DllMain will alway be called first whether the app is loaded as a COM 
   DLL or an ARX application. acrxEntryPoint() will be called after DllMain() is 
   called when the user loads the application as an ARX application.
4. Change project settings to ObjectARX 2002 standards. You need to export 
   acrxGetApiVersion function in the DEF file.
5. Add an Interface Object called IDesignCtrSampleObject.
   Add CWindowImplBase and IAcCeContentView to the base class list.
   Override some base class methods.
6. Insert app_registry.rgs as a new "REGISTRY" resource and setup a
   runtime swappable module called "%AUTH%". This rgs file will be 
   explicitly loaded.
7. Insert the Whip component into the project and the CWhip wrapper class
   is generated.
8. Add a class that is derived from CMDIChildWnd. Add some code to hook the 
   window creation up with the DesignCtrSampleObject actions.
