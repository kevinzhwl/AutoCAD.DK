Readme.txt

Welcome to the ObjectARX 2002 Samples. Each folder below the 'samples' folder contains
a 'Readme.txt' which explains what techniques and API's are exploited by each sample.
In addition, the root 'samples' folder contains a 'SamplesReadMe.htm' HTML document.
This document should be viewed using your browser software. The recommended browser is
Microsoft(R)'s Internet Explorer(TM) but you can use Netscape(TM) if you wish.

This 'SamplesReadMe.htm' HTML document is designed to give you an overview of all the
sample applications that are contained in the sub-folders. In addition to the overview,
a suggested level of difficulty is provided to help all levels of ObjectARX
programmer. We suggest you open the 'SamplesReadMe.htm' HTML file first and read the
document to get an overview of what is to follow.

We wish you every success in your journey through these samples and hope you find them
useful.
