
This example is a simple custom entity defining a square. It supports the 'AsdkSquareWrap'
ATL COM sample in the adjacent subdirectory.

Build this square sample first, then build the 'AsdkSquareWrap' project. The 'AsdkSquareWrap'
project uses the square.lib file produced by building this sample.


1- The Square sample is an ObjectDBX Object Enabler Application which defines a custom entity 
derived from AcDbCurve. The class name for this custom entity is: AsdkSquare

2- The SquareUI sample defines two commands which create an AsdkSquare entity 
defined in the Square module.
   These commands are: 'ASDKSQUARE' (or 'SQ') and 'ASDKADDSQUARE' (or 'ADDSQ')


Command 'ASDKSQUARE' adds a square to model space using only the command line

Command 'ASDKADDSQUARE' adds a square to the current space using both the command line and OPM
In order to use this command you must first compile and register the 'AsdkSquareWrap' COM server 
on your system. Otherwise, the command will refuse to run. To register this server, open and 
modify the 'AsdkSquareLib.reg' file with your local path. When done run this file on your system
to register the COM server.
