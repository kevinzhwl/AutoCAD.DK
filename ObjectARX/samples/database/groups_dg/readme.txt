Description:

This program demonstrates the use of some of the AcDbGroup protocol. It first prompts the user to select some entities that are placed into a group called "ASDK_GROUPTEST". Then it calls the function removeAllButLines() to iterate over the group and remove all the entities that are not lines. Finally, it changes the remaining entities in the group to red. 

To use groups.arx:
1. Start AutoCAD and open a new drawing.
2. Create a number of entities, making sure to include some lines, circles, and arcs.
3. Type the ARX command and load groups.arx.
4. Type the GROUPTST command, defined by groups.arx. Make a selection set that includes at least one line.
5. Verify the contents of the group by typing the GROUP command. In the Object Grouping dialog, click on the name of the group, ASDK_GROUPTEST, in the Group_Name listbox at the top of the dialog. Then click the Highlight button. Only the selected line entities are in the group. They will be shown with a different linetype, usually DASHED. Click the Continue button, then exit the Object Grouping dialog by clicking Cancel.
