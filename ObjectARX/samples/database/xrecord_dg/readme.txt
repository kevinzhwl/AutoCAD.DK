Description:

This program demonstrates using xrecords. Two commands are defined in this program: ASDK_CREATE and ASDK_LISTXREC.

The ASDK_CREATE command calls the function createXrecord(), which instantiates an xrecord object and adds it to a dictionary object in the named objects dictionary.

The ASDK_LISTXREC command calls the listXrecord() function, which opens the dictionary containing the xrecord created by the ASDK_CREATE command and then calls the printList() function to print out the data stored in the xrecord.

To use xrecord.arx:

1. Start AutoCAD and open a new drawing.
2. Type the ARX command and load xrecord.arx.
3. Type the ASDK_CREATE command, defined by xrecord.arx. 
This will create a test xrecord.
4. Type the ASDK_LISTXREC command, defined by xrecord.arx. 
This will list out the xrecord created above.

WARNING: ASDK_LISTXREC command is not meant to be run before ASDK_CREATE. Doing so will cause an error in AutoCAD.
