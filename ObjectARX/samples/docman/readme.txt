Buttons:
-----------

AppContextNew Document:  calls appContextNewDocument.

AppContextOpen Document: calls appContextOpenDocument.

New Doc: calls newDocument()

Open Doc: calls openDocument()

Send String: calls sendStringToExecute with a hardcoded string to draw a line
             from 0,0 to 5,5. Note: you first need to select a document in the
             listbox that specifies which document the string is going to be sent to.

Activate Doc: calls activateDocument. Note: you first need to select a document
              in the listbox.

                   isQuiescent) and displays the documents lock modes too.

Set Current Doc: calls unlockDocument and then setCurDocument. Note: you first need
                 to select a document in the listbox that specifies which document is
                 going to become the current document and also you need to select a
                 lock mode for the document in the lock mode droplist.

                that an event was not intercepted by the modeless dialog.
