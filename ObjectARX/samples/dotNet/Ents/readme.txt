Description: This application implements a command called MKENTS. It will create a line and a circle, append them to an object ID array, change the line's color to red, and then make a group of the line and circle using ASDK_NEWNAME as the group's name. The MKENTS command also creates a new layer named ASDK_MYLAYER.

To use Ents.dll:

1. Start AutoCAD and open a new drawing.
2. Type netload and select Ents.dll.
3. Execute the MKENTS command.
