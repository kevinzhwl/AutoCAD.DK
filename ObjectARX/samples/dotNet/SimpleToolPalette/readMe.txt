SimpleToolPalette C#

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET CustomToolBase class to create a simple Tool Palette client application. 
To run the sample:

	Build and SimpleToolPaletteExample.dll assembly first in Visual Studio.

	Register the COM Server defined within the sample by either double-clicking the 'COM Registration.reg' file to add to the registry or by using the 'RegAsm' tool from Microsoft.

	Copy the Tool1.bmp and the SimpleToolPaletteExample.dll file to the AutoCAD installation folder.

	Start AutoCAD and NETLOAD the SimpleToolPaletteExample.dll you placed in the AutoCAD install folder

	Run the CREATESIMPLE command, which creates a new tool palette named SimplePalette in the Tool Palettes window 
	(use the TP command to invoke the tool palette window).

SimplePalette demonstrates a flyout tool, a command tool, and a plain tool. The flyout tool uses a standard AutoCAD shape 
package to allow the user to exchange the default line tool for a variety of other entity tools. The command tool 
starts the LINE command and lets the user choose the start and end points. The plain tool behaves like a macro that 
creates a line with hard-coded points, with no user input.

This sample also demonstrates a custom tool palette context menu. When the user right-clicks on the SimplePalette, the 
context menu displays three extra items: Menu1, Menu2, and Menu3. Each of these menu items launches an alert box that 
displays the name of the chosen item. When the user right-clicks on any palette other than the SimplePalette, the three 
custom menu items do not appear.
