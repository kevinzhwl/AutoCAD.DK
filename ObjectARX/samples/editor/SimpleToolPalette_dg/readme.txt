This sample demonstrates how to use the AcadToolImpl class to create a rudimentary Tool Palette client application. To run the sample, load the ARX file in AutoCAD and type the CREATESIMPLE command. This command creates a new tool palette named SimplePalette in the Tool Palettes window. 

SimplePalette demonstrates a flyout tool, a command tool, and a plain tool. The flyout tool uses a standard AutoCAD shape package to allow the user to exchange the default line tool for a variety of other entity tools. The command tool starts the LINE command and lets the user choose the start and end points. The plain tool behaves like a macro that creates a line with hard-coded points, with no user input.

This sample also demonstrates a custom tool palette context menu. When the user right-clicks on the SimplePalette, the context menu displays three extra items: Menu1, Menu2, and Menu3. Each of these menu items launches an alert box that displays the name of the chosen item. When the user right-clicks on any palette other than the SimplePalette, the three custom menu items do not appear.
