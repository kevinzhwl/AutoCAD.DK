Smiley
------

The Smiley application demonstrates several things:

 1) How to implement a custom entity ObjectDBX enabler (SmileyDb project).
	* Implementing Osnap and Grip points
	* Different proxy graphics

 2) How to use this custom entity from an ObjectARX application (SmileyUi project).

 3) How to implement a COM Automation interface for a custom entity (SmileyDbCom project).

 4) How to implement a COM Automation interface for an ObjectARX application
    (SmileyUiCom project).

 5) How to support the Properties Window with categorised properties (SmileyDbCom project).

****

You can load AsdkSmileyDb.dbx and AsdkSmileyUi.arx directly into AutoCAD.

To set up the COM wrappers, you need to modify the .REG file in the Smiley directory
to point to the appropriate DLL and TLB locations.

All four files (AsdkSmileyDb.dbx, AsdkSmileyUi.arx, AsdkSmileyDbCom.dll,
AsdkSmileyUiCom.dll) should be placed in the same directory.

AsdkSmileyDb.dbx is designed to be loadable by any ObjectDBX host application,
of which AutoCAD is only one example.

Finally, note that AsdkSmileyDb.dbx and AsdkSmileyUi.arx are being registered in
different areas of the registry.

The acrxRegisterApp() function now has a fifth argument, which defaults
to FALSE.  If FALSE, the application registers under AutoCAD, if TRUE, it registers
under the generic ObjectDBX registry location, where it can be found
by all ObjectDBX host applications.

The UI application demand loads on unknown command invocations.

The custom object application demand loads on proxy detection.
