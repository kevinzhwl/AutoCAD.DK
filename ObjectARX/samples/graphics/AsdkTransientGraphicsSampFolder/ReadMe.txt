This sample demonstrates several things:

1) Adding a Transient Graphics object to Transient Graphics Manager
2) Removing a Transient Graphics object from Transient Graphics Manager
3) Updating Transient Graphics object
4) Show a raster image using new interface AcGiViewportGeometry2


The project has one command:

TGVisibility 
This command prompts the user to create a Transient graphics entity. If “Yes” is selected a 
new Transient graphics entity is created. If “No” is selected a Transient graphics entity is deleted.

Steps to run:

1.	Load the ADSAsdkTransientGraphics.arx into AutoCAD.
2.	Open file DWGMap.dwg
3.	Issue command TGVisibility
4.	Select Yes.
	Mouse mouse over different lan marks present on the map, a custom tooltip with raster image is shown
