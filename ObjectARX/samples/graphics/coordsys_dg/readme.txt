Description:                       

viewportDraw() (transforms)        

This example demonstrates the use of isPerspective(), doPerspective(),  getBackAndFrontClippingValues(), polygonDc(), polygonEye(), and polygon().

To do this, it takes an original line segment in model coordinates and creates its equivalents in eye coordinates and display coordinates. When displayed, all the lines will overlap exactly.

Procedure:
1. Load coordsys.arx.
2. Command: ASDKCOORDSAMP

The ObjectARX Developer's Guide and the source code explain what took place in more detail.
