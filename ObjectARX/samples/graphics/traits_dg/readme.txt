Description:

worldDraw() (subentity traits)

This sample demonstrates using many of the AcGiSubEntityTraits class functions for controlling the properties of the graphics primitives drawn during entity elaboration.

Procedure:
1. Load traits.arx.
2. Command: LINETYPE Load DASHDOT from acad.lin
3. Command: LAYER Make MY_LAYER Color Red
4. Command: ASDKTRAITSSAMP

A three-point blue polyline at (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) and an XLINE in MY_LAYER using DASHDOT line type should appear.

The ObjectARX Developer's Guide and the source code explain what took place in more detail.
