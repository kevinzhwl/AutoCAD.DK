
This sample demonstrates how to create a very basic Start-up wizard for AutoCAD.

The StartWiz.arx application has two commands: StartWiz and ShowWiz.

StartWiz:  This brings up the start-up dialog.  The buttons are self-explanatory; there is also
a Help button that users can click on to get more information on each button.

ShowWiz:  If the Hide option was checked in the dialog, then the StartWiz command will not bring 
the dialog back up.  In such cases, the ShowWiz command should be used.
