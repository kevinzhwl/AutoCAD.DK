Rect Sample

 (C) Copyright 1998 by Autodesk, Inc.
This program duplicates but enhanses the autolisp rectangle command, formerly in acadr14.lsp, but uses AcEdJig to be able to adjust for the current ucs normal. In addition, elevation, and thickness are supported. Note that sysvars are NOT changed by this command. ie plinewid, chamfera, chamferb, elevation, are NOT affected by this command.

The sample demonstrates how to port the non MDI aware source (badrectang.cpp) to Tahoe making it MDI aware (rectangle.cpp).
