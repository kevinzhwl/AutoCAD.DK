1.Abstract
==========

This sample shows how to create dynamic properties in the Object Property Manager of AutoCAD.

2. Build Instructions
=====================

1. Load SimpleDynProps.dsw
2. Choose the target you want to build
3. Build the project (Build/Build SimpleDynProps.arx)

There are 3 different targets for SimpleDynProps:
a, Win32 Debug - the project will be built debug Microsoft debug information (pdb)
b, Win32 Release MinSize - the project is built without debug information, with compiler optimizations, dynamically linking Atl.dll
c, Win32 Release MinDependency - the project is built without debug information, with compiler optimizations, statically linking Atl.dll

3. How it works, What it shows
==============================

OPM can show so-called dynamic properties in addition to the "static" properties of an object. Dynamic properties can be used for many different purpose. In this example we have three properties that show three values stored in an AcDbXrecord that resides in the extension dictionary of an entity.

The following figure shows this scenario:

AcDbEntity
|_AcDbDictionary
       |_AcDbXrecord (double, double, long)

Dynamic properties are COM objects that implement at least the IDynamicProperty interface. (There are other interfaces that can flavor how the dynamic property is shown in OPM)

Since the sample has to implement a COM object, it uses ATL (Microsoft Active Template Library) to simplify the process. 

The sample currently shows three properties:
1. A simple property (SimpleProperty.h, SimpleProperty.cpp). This implements IDyanamicProperty alone.
2. A categorized property (CategorizedProperty.h, CategorizedProperty.cpp). This implements IDynamicProperty and ICategorizeProperties.
3. An enumerated property (Enumproperty.h, EnumProperty.cpp). This implements IDynamicProperty, ICategorizeProperties and IEnumProperty

Since the OPM is a modeless user interface, the sample shows the document locking step necessary to access the drawing.

Here are the steps to try the sample:
1. Load SimpleDynProps.arx
2. Bring up OPM (modify command)
3. Draw any entity
4. Use the assigndata command to assign the xrecord to the entity
5. Click on the entity to see its properties.
6. Change the values in the xrecord through the dynamic properties.
