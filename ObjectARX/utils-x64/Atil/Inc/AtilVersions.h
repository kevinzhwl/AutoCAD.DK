/// the ATIL.lib library itself. 
/// </summary>
///
/// <remarks>
/// The Minor version below is incremented for:
/// 1) The addition of new classes being defined
/// 2) Special cases of binary compatible API additions to existing classes (methods)
/// 3) Major changes of internal logic while maintaining the API. These changes
///    may change implementation behavior while not changing the published usage.
///    This could be interpreted as a warning not to depend on implementation 
///    side effects of ATIL objects. 
///
/// The Major version is incremented when a change is made that renders previous
/// versions of the client api incompatible with the new release of the ATIL. It
/// means that applications will/may need to "port" their application including
/// binary or API incompatibility.

/// The Minor version below is incremented for:
