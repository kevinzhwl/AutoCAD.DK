//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBr struct contains enumerated types that are unique to the 
// AcBr library and which are used as return codes or on the argument 
// list of local class functions. Abbreviations and aliases (e.g.,
// for obsoletised values) are exported in brgblabb.h.
//
// The ErrorStatus enum is returned by all non Boolean valued functions.
// The error code may be either a global AutoCAD error code (as listed 
// in the Acad::ErrorStatus enum), cast to the local AcBr::ErrorStatus 
// enum, or a local boundary representation library error code. The 
// local error codes are defined using a starting base of 3000, so 
// as not to conflict with the AutoCAD, Mechanical API or Autodesk 
// Mechanical Desktop error codes.
//
// The Relation enum captures the relation of geometry objects
// (i.e., points and curves) to bounded geometry subsets of a solid
// (e.g., the relation of a point to a solid, or the relation of
// a curve to a face in which it may be partially or completely
// embedded). The kInside and kOutside values are relative to the
// geometric bounds of the queried topology object, as determined
// by the direction of the normals along the object's boundary.
//
// The Element2dShape enum controls the shape of elements generated 
// by a 2d mesh. It is only relevant to the mesh filter. A 1d mesh 
// (corresponding to the discretization of the boundary curves of 
// the original face) can be emulated by specifying kAllPolygons.
//
// The LoopType enum classifies a loop as interior/exterior/etc.
// Peripheral loops are kLoopExterior, and there is only one such 
// loop per face (by industry convention). Holes are returned as 
// kLoopInterior, and there may be several per face (providing there 
// is also an exterior loop). Cones and cylinders (whether with an 
// elliptical or circular base) have at least two base loops (if 
// they are complete in both u and v), which are returned as 
// kLoopWinding vs. kLoopExterior due to the restriction of there 
// being just one exterior loop (along with the fact that neither 
// base loop is a hole). Singularities (such as the apex of a cone) 
// are returned as kLoopUnclassified. All loops on spheric and toric 
// surfaces, as well as closed periodic nurbs, return kLoopUnclassified.
//
// The ValidationLevel enum sets the level of validation for an AcBr* 
// object. If kFullValidation (the default upon object instantiation) 
// is specified, every function that accesses the brep topology 
// (directly or indirectly) first checks the associated AutoCAD 
// database object to see if it has been modified since the AcBr* 
// object was last set This is an expensive operation, but guarantees 
// all brep data is within scope. If kNoValidation is specified, the 
// database is not checked unless it is critical to the completion of
// the function's tasks. This is more efficient, but does not guarantee 
// the brep data is within scope. Setting the validation level on an
// object by object basis prevents any collsions between multiply 
// loaded apps.
//
// The ShellType enum classifies a shell as interior/exterior/etc.
// Peripheral shells are returned as kShellExterior, and there is only 
// one such shell per brep or region (by industry convention). Voids
// are returned as kShellInterior, and there may be several per brep 
// or complex (providing there is also an exterior shell).
