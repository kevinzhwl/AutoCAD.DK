/// <remarks>
/// The fact that all ATIL exceptions are derived from this class makes
/// creation of a generic catch-all easier. It is recommended however,
/// that the specific exception is caught when it is thrown to facilitate

/// Generally exceptions are used in ATIL for where unexpected errors 
/// occur only. Methods that have expected failure states will return them
/// with method specific return codes. For example, FileReadDescriptor 
/// assumes that the file path you send it is valid and readable and will
/// throw an exception if it is not. To test for readability, 
/// FileReadDescriptor exposes a method isDecodableFile that returns a
/// enum code regarding the readability of a file that should be called
/// prior to constructing a FileReadDescriptor.
