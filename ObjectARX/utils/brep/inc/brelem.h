// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrElement class is the interface base class for mesh elements.
// All the functionality supported by this class is implemented by the
// class AcBrImpElement.
//
// This class defines the functions that are common to all dimensions
// of mesh elements, and cannot be directly set by the user as the
// initialisation requirements are only available internally at the
// time of a call to AcBrMesh::generate().
//
// An element is a minimal closed, ordered subset of connected nodes 
// in a mesh.
