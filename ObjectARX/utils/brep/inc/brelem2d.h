//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrElement2d class is the interface class for linear, first-
// order two-dimensional elements in a mesh. All the functionality
// supported by this class is implemented by the class AcBrImpElement2d.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to the 2d
// element level of a mesh, and cannot be directly set by the user
// as the initialisation requirements are only available internally
// at the time of a call to AcBrMesh2d::generate().
//
// A 2d element is a planar approximation of a subset of a bounded
// surface and thus has no directly associated geometry. It represents
// a polygonal (i.e., closed) set of at least three co-planar nodes in
// a mesh (Note that the associated node coordinates can be used to
// instantiate an AcGePlane). A mapping back to the original brep
// topology is provided in the form of a backpointer to the face which
// generated this element (cf. AcBrMeshEntity::getEntityAssociated()).
//
// This class generally is accessed by the user via a mesh element 
// traverser. The only way to delete the element referenced by this class
// from the mesh data cache is to delete the mesh object that owns it,
// or to regenerate the mesh.
//
// The set() element data initialiser is for internal use only. It is used
// to set this mesh element's internal data using an unexported type.
//
// The get() element data query is for internal use only. It retrieves
// this mesh element's internal data using an unexported type.
//
// The getNormal() element normal query returns the normalised model
// space normal vector computed on the plane defined by the element 
// nodes traversed in a clockwise direction. The normal vector is 
// returned as an AcGeVector3d, with the entire chain of transforms 
// from the original face applied. The vector is instantiated by the 
// caller and passed by reference for getNormal() to set. If this mesh 
// element object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned. 
// If there are fewer than three nodes in the element, or if the nodes
// are colinear (as measured to within a tolerance of 1.0e-10 on the
// dot products of the vectors from one node to the next), Acad::
// eDegenerateGeometry is returned. In the event of an error, the 
// normal vector reference argument's value is unchanged.
