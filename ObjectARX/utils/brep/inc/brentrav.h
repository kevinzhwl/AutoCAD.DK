// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrElement2dNodeTraverser class is the interface class for
// element node traversers. All the functionality supported by this
// class is implemented by the class AcBrImpElement2dNodeTraverser.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to a node
// in the context of a 2d element. It is used to get access to node
// data contexted to the true geometry of the original surface, such
// as surface normals and uv parameter pairs (nodes are used by more
// than one mesh element and may also be associated with more than
// one surface). Nodes are consistently traversed in a clockwise
// direction on the element, as defined by the original face.
//
// The default constructor instantiates an uninitialised object. The
// function isNull() returns kTrue on an object created this way. To
// set an AcBrElement2dNodeTraverser, call setElement() using a valid,
// previously instantiated 2d element object.
//
// The setElement() list owner initialiser(1) is used to set this
// traverser to a specific element node list, starting at the
// first node in the list. This initialises a traverser instantiated
// with the default constructor, and resets the criteria for next()
// and done(). If the element reference object is uninitialised,
// Acad::eInvalidInput is returned. In the event of an error,
// this traverser's element node list is unchanged.
//
// The setElement() list owner initialiser(2) is used to set this
// traverser to a specific element node list, starting at the
// first node in the list. This initialises a traverser instantiated
// with the default constructor, and resets the criteria for next()
// and done(). If the mesh element traverser reference object is
// uninitialised, Acad::eInvalidInput is returned. In the event of
// an error, this traverser's element node list is unchanged.
//
// The getElement() list owner query returns the element owner of the
// element node list. The element object is instantiated by the caller
// and passed by reference for getElement() to set. If this traverser
// object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned. In the
// event of an error, the element reference object is unchanged and
// is thus likely to be uninitialised.
//
// The setNode() list position initialiser is used to set this
// traverser's starting position to a specific node in the element
// node list, which resets the criteria for next() and done(). If
// this traverser object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is
// returned. If the associated mesh object has been modified since the
// traverser was last set, eMeshChanged is returned. If the node
// reference object is uninitialised, or if the associated mesh object
// has been modified since the node reference object was last set,
// Acad::eInvalidInput is returned. If the node is not in the element
// node list or is associated with a different mesh object or revision,
// Acad::eInvalidInput is returned. In the event of an error, this
// traverser's element node list is unchanged.
//
// The getNode() list position query returns the node at the current
// position in the element node list. The node object is instantiated
// by the caller and passed by reference for getNode() to set. If this
// traverser object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned.
// In the event of an error, the node reference object is unchanged and
// is thus likely to be uninitialised.
//
// The getSurfaceNormal() surface normal query returns the normalised
// model space normal vector computed on the original face at the 
// current node. The normal vector is returned as an AcGeVector3d, 
// with the entire chain of transforms from the original face applied. 
// The vector is instantiated by the caller and passed by reference for
// getSurfaceNormal() to set. If this traverser object is uninitialised, 
// eUninitialisedObject is returned. In the event of an error, the 
// normal vector reference argument's value is unchanged.
//
// The getParamPoint() parameter space point query returns the 2d
// element node's underlying parameter point as an AcGePoint2d, with
// the entire chain of transforms from the original face ignored as
// they are only pertinent to model space. The parameter point
// corresponds to the node's model space point projected onto the
// uv parameter space grid of the surface associated with the original
// face that generated this 2d element. A 2d point is a convenient
// way to represent a u,v parameter pair. The parameter point is
// instantiated by the caller and passed by reference for getParamPoint()
// to set. If this traverser object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject
// is returned. In the event of an error, the parameter point reference
// argument's value is unchanged.
