//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrLoop class is the interface class for brep loops. All the
// functionality supported by this class is implemented by the class
// AcBrImpLoop.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to the loop
// level of a brep topology adjacency hierarchy, which is not exposed
// as a subentity type in AutoCAD and thus cannot be directly set by
// the user; it is set indirectly by the traversers. It is also used
// to set the first loop of a loop list in AcBrFaceLoopTraverser. 
//
// Loops are secondary brep elements and thus have no associated
// geometry. Conceptually, a loop corresponds to a set of neighbouring
// boundary curves on a bounded surface. 
//
// The default constructor instantiates an empty object. The function
// isNull() returns kTrue on an object created this way. To set an
// AcBrLoop, call AcBrFaceLoopTraverser::getLoop() or
// AcBrEdgeLoopTraverser::getLoop() using this loop object as input.
//
// The getFace() upward adjacency query returns the face that is
// bounded by this loop (always unique). The face is instantiated by 
// the caller and passed by reference for getFace() to set. If this
// loop object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned. If 
// the associated AutoCAD object has been modified since the subentity
// path was last set, eBrepChanged is returned. If the face is missing
// or fails to map to a valid subentity ID, Acad::eNotInDatabase is
// returned. In the event of an error, the face reference object is
// unchanged and is thus likely to be uninitialised.
//
// The getType() loop type query returns a dedicated LoopType enum which
// identifies this loop as being either kLoopExterior or kLoopInterior.
// Note that ambiguous loops on closed periodic surfaces (whether nurb
// parametric or analytic) return kLoopUnclassified; whereas base loops
// on cones and cylinders generally return kLoopWinding.
