// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrMesh class is the interface base class for meshes. All
// the functionality supported by this class is implemented by
// the class AcBrImpMesh.
//
// This class defines the functions that are common to all dimensions
// of meshes, and cannot be instantiated as it has no meaning on
// its own.
//
// A mesh is a network of nodal approximations to curves, surfaces and
// volumes in a brep object (or subobject), and thus has associated
// geometry. The geometry, however, is stored at the individual
// elements and nodes, as are the mappings back to the original brep
// topology. Each supported dimension of meshing has its own associated
// class. General faceting is exposed through the AcBrMesh2d subclass.
