//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrNode class is the interface class for nodes in a mesh.
// All the functionality supported by this class is implemented
// by the class AcBrImpNode.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to the node
// level of a mesh, and cannot be directly set by the user as the
// initialisation requirements are only available internally at
// the time of a call to AcBrMesh2d::generate().
//
// A node is the intersection or terminating point of two or more
// edges in a mesh, and thus has associated geometry (i.e., a point).
// A mapping back to the original brep topology is provided in the
// form of a backpointer to the dimensionally lowest topology object
// that contains this node (cf. AcBrMeshEntity::getEntityAssociated()).
// If this node is part of a 2d mesh, the associated entity type
// can be used to classify interior (i.e., face) vs. boundary
// (i.e., edge or vertex) nodes. Surface usage data (such as uv
// parameters and surface normals) must be queried in the context
// of 2d elements using AcBrElement2dNodeTraverser.
//
// This class generally is accessed by the user via an element node
// traverser. The only way to delete the node referenced by this class
// from the mesh data cache is to delete the mesh object that owns it,
// or to regenerate the mesh.
//
// The set() node data initialiser is for internal use only. It is used
// to set this mesh node's internal data using an unexported type.
//
// The get() node data query is for internal use only. It retrieves
// this mesh node's internal data using an unexported type.
//
// The getPoint() model space point query returns this node's underlying
// point as an AcGePoint3d, with the entire chain of transforms from 
// the associated topology object's subentity path applied. The point 
// is instantiated by the caller and passed by reference for getPoint()
// to set. If this node object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject
// is returned. In the event of an error, the point reference argument's
// value is unchanged.
