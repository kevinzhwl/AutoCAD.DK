// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrMassProps struct contains the volume, the mass (equal
// to the volume unless the density is specified as anything other
// than unity), the centroid (centre of gravity), the radii of
// gyration (square root of the moments of inertia divided by
// the rigid body mass), the rigid body moments of inertia (mass
// times the square of the axial radius), the products of inertia
// (mass times the distance from the centroid to the yz plane
// times the distance from the centroid to the xz plane), the
// principal moments at the centroid (derived from the products
// of inertia) and the principal axes at the centroid.
