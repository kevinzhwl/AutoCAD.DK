//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
// The AcBrVertex class is the interface class for brep vertices.
// All the functionality supported by this class is implemented by
// the class AcBrImpVertex.
//
// This class defines the functions that are pertinent to the vertex
// level of a brep topology adjacency hierarchy, and thus serves as
// a mapping between an AutoCAD vertex subentity and AcBr. It is
// also used to set the vertex owner of a vertex edge list in
// AcBrVertexEdgeTraverser, or the vertex-loop in
// AcBrVertexLoopTraverser.
//
// Vertices are primary brep elements and thus have associated geometry
// (i.e., points). This class provides an indirect link between AcGe
// and AcDb3dSolid, AcDbSurface, AcDbRegion and AcDbBody.
//
// The default constructor instantiates an empty object. The function
// isNull() returns kTrue on an object created this way. To set an
// AcBrVertex, call set() with a subentity path that contains the object
// ID for an AutoCAD solid, surface, region or body along with its chain of
// transforms (using nested AcDbBlockReferences) and a vertex subentity.
// Singularities cannot be used to directly set an AcBrVertex object,
// as they are represented in AutoCAD as an edge subentity; use AcBrEdge
// instead. They may, however, be queried using an AcBrLoopVertexTraverser.
//
// The getPoint() model space point query is deprecated in favour of the
// efficient new getPoint() query which sets an already-instantiated point.
//
// The getPointRelationToVertex() and getCurveRelationToVertex()
// set-membership classifications are deprecated in favour of
// getPointContainment() and getLineContainment().
//
// The getPoint() model space point query returns this vertex' underlying
// point as an AcGePoint3d, with the entire chain of transforms from the
// subentity path applied. The point is instantiated by the caller and
// passed by reference pointer for getPoint() to set. If this vertex
// object is uninitialised, eUninitialisedObject is returned. If the
// associated AutoCAD object has been modified since the subentity path
// was last set, eBrepChanged is returned. If the point geometry is
// missing, Acad::eDegenerateGeometry is returned. In the event of an
// error, the point reference argument's value is unchanged.
