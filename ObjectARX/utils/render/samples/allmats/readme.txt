Allmats draws a (roughly) square grid of cubes, one for each material in
the specified material library, and applies a material to each.  Each cube
is also titled with the name of the material, and the grid is titled with
the name of the library file.

NOTE:  You must run RENDER in Photo Real or Photo Raytrace mode to see
the materials properly.
