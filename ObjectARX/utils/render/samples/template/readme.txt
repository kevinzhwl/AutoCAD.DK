AVLIB TEMPLATE README

This project constitutes a skeleton ARX application that uses the AVLib 
interface to Render.arx.

This template follows the form of an ADS application migrated to ARX.
(See Appendix A of the ARX Developer's Guide.)  It uses acedDefun(), rather
than acedRegCmds->addCommand(), so functions are callable from AutoLISP.
(Using acedRegCmds->addCommand() for apps that use AVLib is not recommended.)
